<p>First, you’ll need to enable virtualization which is a CPU feature that helps run secondary operating systems like Android in our case. Newer computers will need you to flip the switch in the BIOS/UEFI settings, usually called Intel VT-X or AMD-V, depending upon the brand of CPU in your system. Then, you also need to enable it inside Windows 11.</p>
