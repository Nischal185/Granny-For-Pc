  This game is based on a lady named Tamara, who's a 68 year old that they called a Granny Ripper. because she would kill her victims, dismember them, and then eat them. And she admitted to killing at least 11 people. that we know of, which includes her husband.

The easiest way Granny is capable of tracking the player is through noise. As such, creating noise in one room while going to another is an easy way to throw her off of your trail if you need to perform something time-consuming.</p>

<p> Although Granny is very attentive and can track any noise to its exact location, she isn't exceptionally smart and is easily fooled by even some of the most obvious hiding spots. Just be aware that she will not ignore you if she sees you entering a hiding place, and will punish you if you aren't completely out of reach.</p>

<p> Sometimes it is possible to drop items without making noise. This can be done on soft furniture, cabinets, desks, shelves, certain tables, and grass.</p>

<p> While some floors of the house creak and create noise, they can be avoided if you know where they are located, allowing you to travel through rooms much quieter.</p>

<p> With the exception of extreme difficulty, you can outrun Granny provided you don't get cornered. Additionally, it is possible to delay her progress during chases by closing doors in her way.</p>
